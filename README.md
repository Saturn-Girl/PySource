if for windows
nasm -f win64 SourcePLayer_win.asm - SourcePLayer_win.obj
If for linux
If aiming as Linux then do
nasm -f elf64 SourcePlayer_Linux.asm -o SourcePlayer_Linux.obj

after that use GoLink
GoLink.exe /dll /entry _DllMainCRTStartup SourcePLayer_win.obj _start


why not for linux as .so
IDK how to use gcc
